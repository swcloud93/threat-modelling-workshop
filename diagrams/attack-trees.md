## Easiest Path Analysis

| Path | Steps | Difficulty | Detection Risk |
|------|-------|------------|----------------|
| SQL Injection | 3 | Medium | Low (if no WAF) |
| Phishing | 4 | Low | Medium |
| Insider | 3 | Low | High (if monitored) |
| Physical | 3 | High | High |

**Most Likely Attack**: Phishing (low difficulty, medium detection)
**Highest Impact**: SQL Injection (can dump entire database)

## Mitigation Priority

Focus controls on the easiest paths:
1. Security awareness training (blocks phishing)
2. WAF and input validation (blocks SQLi)
3. Privileged access monitoring (detects insider)

## Design Detection Points
For each attack step, identify how to detect it:

| Attack Step | Detection Method | Alert Threshold |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Recon | OSINT monitoring | N/A |
| Phishing email | Email gateway | Suspicious links |
| Credential theft | Failed login spike | >5 failures |
| VPN login | Geo-anomaly | New location |
| Lateral movement | Network anomaly | New connections |
| Data export | DLP alert | >1000 records |
| Exfiltration | Traffic anomaly | Large outbound |
